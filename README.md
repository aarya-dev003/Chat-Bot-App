# AI Chat Bot App

This Android application was developed using Kotlin and integrates with the GPT API (Davinci-003) to create an interactive chatbot experience. The app employs Retrofit to handle HTTP requests for seamless communication with the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatting:** Users can engage in conversations with the AI-powered chatbot.
- **Kotlin Implementation:** The app is built entirely using Kotlin, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **API Integration:** Utilizes Retrofit library to manage HTTP requests, facilitating communication with the GPT API (Davinci-003).
- **Davinci-003 Model:** Integrates the latest GPT version, Davinci-003, to provide advanced conversational capabilities.

## Setup

To run the AI Chat Bot App:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Ensure necessary dependencies are installed.
4. Update the necessary API credentials or endpoints in the app code.
5. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.

## Dependencies

The app relies on the following key libraries/frameworks:

- **Kotlin:** The programming language used for app development.
- **Retrofit:** For handling HTTP requests and API communication.
- **GPT API (Davinci-003):** Utilized for generating conversational responses.

## Usage

Upon launching the app, users can begin conversing with the chatbot. The app sends user input to the GPT API (Davinci-003), processes the response, and displays it in the app's interface.
